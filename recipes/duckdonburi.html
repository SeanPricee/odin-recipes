    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Duck Legs</li>
        <li>125ml (1/2 Cop) Water</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Light Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Dark Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp Rice Wine</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Dark Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>85g (1/2 Cup) Long Grain White Rice</li>
        <li>50 g (1 carrot around 10-15cm) Carrot</li>
        <li>2 Spring onions</li>
        <li>1 Large or 2 Small Bok Choi (about 250g total)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt (For the Rice Water and Egg)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Sesame Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the soy sauces, rice wine, water, and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Score the skin of the duck breast and place it in an ovenproof dish.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce mix over the duck and place in the oven at 180˚C or 350˚F for 90 minutes, basting the exposed duck with the sauce every 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the duck legs from the oven and set aside for 10-12 minutes under foil.</li>
        <li>Drain the fat from the cooking sauce and set aside.</li>
        <li>Have a pan of boiling water ready for when the duck is ready to remove.</li>
        <li>Season the water with a generous teaspoon of sea salt and add the rice.</li>
        <li>Cut the bok choi into quarters.</li>
        <li>Place the bok choi in the bowl dish that the duck legs have come out of, cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off on the oven and put the bok choi dish into it and allow it to sit for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down under the rice and simmer for 10 minutes or until the rice is slightly al dente, then drain through a fine-mesh sieve.</li>
        <li>Allow the rice to sit for a minute to steam dry a little then fork through to fluff up.</li>
        <li>Use a vegetable peeler to create ribbons of carrot.</li>
        <li>Slice the spring onions at 45 degree angle 2-3mm thick.</li>
        <li>Shred your duckand dress with some of the cooking liquid just before frying your eggs.</li>
        <li>Fry your eggs, how you prefer them, for me, it needs a crispy fringe and a runny yolk.</li>
        <li>Place the rice in the bottom of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots followed by the duck</li>
        <li>Drain the bok choi and add then add the egg.</li>
        <li>Finally, sprinkle with sesame seeds, spring onion, and a drizzle of toasted sesame oil.</li>
    </ol>
